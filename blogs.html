      <h2>Our Amazing College Trip</h2>
      <p>
        Last month, our group went on an unforgettable college trip to the mountains.  
        We explored nature, shared stories around the bonfire, and created memories that will last a lifetime.  
        Everyone enjoyed team activities and bonding moments.
